                            My name is Cara Crotty. I was born and raised in the Philippines. Outdoor activities including hiking and nature photography are some of things I enjoy. I also enjoy traveling with my husband. In my spare time, I like learning to program, cooking, baking and taking care of my plants.

                            I attended public schools and received a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Engineering from Polytechnic University of the Philippines. After college, I worked in various call center providing technical support for a few years. Then, I had a role as a programmer developing backend systems for a startup focused on products for the travel industry.
